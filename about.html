            <p class="falling-text">
                As a passionate fresher, I am deeply interested in coding and the creative process of developing websites.
                The world of technology excites me, and each new project brings an opportunity to learn and grow. I find immense
                joy in solving complex problems and transforming ideas into functional and visually appealing web applications.
            </p>
            <p class="falling-text">
                From a young age, I’ve always been fascinated by how things work, and this curiosity has led me to explore
                the realms of programming. Building something from scratch, whether it’s a website or a small coding project,
                gives me a sense of fulfillment. Every line of code I write is a step toward mastering the art of development.
            </p>
            <p class="falling-text">
                My enthusiasm for technology goes beyond just coding. I constantly challenge myself to stay updated with the
                latest tools and trends. This drive helps me not only to solve problems more efficiently but also to create
                unique and innovative digital experiences.
            </p>
            <p class="falling-text">
                Coding isn’t just about writing commands—it’s about creating something meaningful, and that’s what I love the most.
